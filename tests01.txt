Let's begin by checking that BinItem and Bin exist.

  >>> from warehouse import BinItem, Bin


BinItems
========

BinItems consist of sku and quantity attributes, which are both displayed
when a BinItem is printed.

  >>> item = BinItem('12345-27', 2136)
  >>> item.sku
  '12345-27'
  >>> item.quantity
  2136
  >>> print(item)
  SKU 12345-27: 2136
